These are a by-product of a Fomorian’s core and will only appear in and around planets with a Fomorian present.\nFomorian Vessels will intermittently appear in the Solar System as event nodes. These event nodes will be locked until you have the Fomorian Disruptor in your Consumable Inventory.\nYou will receive a Blueprint from the Lotus for the Fomorian Disruptor. It will require Nano Spores, Cryotic, and Omega Isotopes to craft.\nBuild your Disruptor in the Foundry and equip it in your Gear Menu to start the Fomorian Sabotage Mission.\nThe Fomorian’s internal Shield Generators are protected by a magnetic field. Use your Fomorian Disruptor from the Gear menu to disrupt the magnetic field, and temporarily expose the Shield Generators, allowing you to destroy them.\nYour Fomorian Disruptor will be consumed after completing the Fomorian Sabotage mission.\nLeaderboards are available for players that want to compete for the best score during Fomorian Sabotage Missions. Your individual score is determined by the amount of damage dealt to the Fomorian Power Core during a single run. The highest scores can only be achieved by squads with coordinated deployment of Fomorian Disruptors, and efficient attacks on the Power Cores."
